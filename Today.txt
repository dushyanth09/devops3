$ git checkout experiment
$ git rebase master
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: added staged command

It works by going to the common ancestor of the two branches (the one you’re on and the one you’re rebasing onto), getting the diff introduced by each commit of the branch you’re on, saving those diffs to temporary files, resetting the current branch to the same commit as the branch you are rebasing onto, and finally applying each change in turn

At this point, you can go back to the master branch and do a fast-forward merge.

$ git checkout master
$ git merge experiment

Fast-forwarding the master branch

$ git checkout master
$ git merge experiment

A history with a topic branch off another topic branch

git rebase --onto master server client

git rebase --onto master server client

$ git checkout master
$ git merge client

Fast-forwarding your master branch to include the client branch changes

git rebase master server

$ git checkout master
$ git merge server
